	<h2>Q: What do I do if I get a weird backend error?</h2>
	<p>A: Try logging out, clearing your internet cookies, plug-ins, and passwords and logging back in. If that does not work, try making a new account and be sure to send a description of your issue in the available feedback option. Please remember that we are just beginning and will need some time to work out all of the kinks.</p>
