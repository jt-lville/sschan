This is Francis's Private Repo.

This is where all of the actual development should take place.

This is the README file
I'm not sure if it's necessary, but we could use it as a changelog. 
Meaning that any major updates (Backend or Frontend), should be reported in here.
Small, quickfix updates do not need to be reported, unless it is a bug-fix
